Here's a "simple" phrase that may save you some headaches.

Code the requirement, pass the policy.



{% highlight ruby %}
And 'I have filled out my billing info' do
  @client.update_attribute :billing_info_valid, true
     
And 'I have filled out my billing info' do
  Factory(:payment_card, :user => @client)
  
{% endhighlight %}
