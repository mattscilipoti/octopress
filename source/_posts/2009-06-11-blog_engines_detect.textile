h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). 11 Jun 2009 - Reston, VA

I wanted to start a blog.  I did not want to use a formal engine (too much work) or a dead simple static file system (too lame).  Then I found http://pages.github.com/.  It was simple, with functionality: <code> for post in site.posts </code>

h2. Choose.

Update (2009-06-12 17:18)

I, incorrectly, created my repo as mattscilipoti instead of mattscilipoti.github.com.  After staring at "Page does not exist!" for a few hours, I put in a support request.  A short wait and <a href='http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/907-github-pages-not-found-for-mattscilipotigithubcom'>I had my answer:</a>

<blockquote>
  "I don't think Pages setup fires on a repo rename, only the initial create. Delete your repo, recreate it, and re-push and you should get a PM that the page has built."
</blockquote>

Edit.  Delete.  Create.  git push.  Wait a few minutes.  tada.  What you see.
