title: Email causing SocketError on Heroku?

Getting a SocketError while sending emails on heroku, using sendgrid?  It may be some gmail env vars.

While working on a project that I just inherited, we enabled sendgrid for our heroku app.  Sending an email raised this error:

h2. SocketError (getaddrinfo: Name or service not known)

Google searches indicated ActiveMailer configuration issues, but Heroku was pretty clear:
  <pre>Rails apps using ActionMailer will just work, no setup is needed after the addon is installed.</pre>
  
While ensuring that RACK_ENV was set correctly (when all else fails), I found these two settings:
<pre>GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD         => #blahblah#
GMAIL_SMTP_USER             => admin@xyz.com</pre>

Removing them fixed my email.  Sendgrid is working fine.

Armed with this evidence, I found "tech_sending_email_with_gmail":http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2009/11/9/tech_sending_email_with_gmail/
And so... someone had  set up the server for gmail, but something about it was failing now.

Now I know.  And you do too.

Note: this is just *one* cause of this error.
