%h3 
  So... I migrated to 
  %a{:href => 'http://github.com/imathis/octopress'} Octopress.
  
A(nother) blogging framework for hackers.

%h3  Why?
I have been using Jekyll with GitHub Pages since June 2009.  GitHub was processing my raw pages, so I was forced to use MarkDown or Textile.
I prefer Haml; with a dash of the :markdown filter.

%h3 The Migration
:textile
  The setup took a little more effort than a base Jekyll site, but I received a bit more functionality.  And Haml.
  The docs and wiki are quite helpful.
  Octopress is based on Jekyll, so it felt familiar.
You can see the source at 
%a{:href=>'http://github.com/mattscilipoti/my_blog'} GitHub.

:textile  
  My Steps:
  1. clone octopress
  2. Configure feedburner; sidebar w/ twitter, delicious; google analytics and search (more vars in default.haml)
  3. Assign blog :title and :author.  Simply by setting the appropriate vars in source/layouts/default.haml.
  4. Copy over my posts.  
  5. Create layout for old posts.  New layout uses meta data.
  6. Moved location into post meta.  Retrieve post.data[:location]
  
%h3 Ch... Ch... Changes

:textile

  Here are some of the differences.
  1. _posts -> source/_posts
  2. Embracing compass => many sass partials.
  3. Configure using vars in layout.

%h3 Conclusion
Enjoying it so far.  Happy I switched.  Now... it's time to work on this layout.
