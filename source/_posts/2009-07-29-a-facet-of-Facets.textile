p(meta). 29 Jul 2009 - Bethesda, MD

I just updated to Rails 2.3.3 and my controllers screamed:

<pre>
undefined local variable or method `set_test_assigns' for #<ActionController::TestResponse:0xb5d0b488>
/home/matt/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facets-2.5.2/lib/core/facets/kernel/tap.rb:9:in `instance_eval'
/home/matt/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facets-2.5.2/lib/core/facets/kernel/tap.rb:9:in `tap'
/home/matt/develop/clients/nih/mpr.ror/trunk/spec/controllers/about_controller_spec.rb:11:
</pre>

Turns out Facets #tap is stomping on another #tap.


h2. Enter facet library loading.

Instead of loading the entire Facets library, load what you need.
I knew this.  You knew this.  It was just convenient to ignore it.
I'm using Facets for ergo.  That's it.  No need for the kitchen sink.

Replace:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.gem 'facets', :version => '=2.5.2'
{% endhighlight %}

With:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.gem 'facets', :version => '=2.5.2', :lib => 'facets/kernel/ergo'
{% endhighlight %}

Done.  Error averted.  Tiny library loaded.

h2. Now... what about specs?

I prefer to write a failing spec that identifies a "bug" and then write code to make it pass.
This issue broke many existing specs, so I feel that I am covered.
Still... it would be nice to have something which identifies this particular issue AND the fix for it.

h2. Update (07/29/2009): funky formatting.

  %(update)Update (07/30/2009): using div as workaround.%
I see the code format isn't quite right.  It works locally (using `jekyll --pygments --auto --server`).
Here's a screenshot:

Argh.

Maybe these guys can help: "github support ticket":http://support.github.com/discussions/site/701-formatting-issues-for-github-pages-pygment-related
